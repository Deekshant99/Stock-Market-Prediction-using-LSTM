# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-LSTM
This project seeks to utilize Deep Learning models, LongShort Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm to predict stock prices. We will use Keras to build a LSTM RNN to predict stock prices using historical closing price and trading volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time and the optimal parameters for the model.
